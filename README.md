# Library-Management-System
This full-stack Library Management System, built with MongoDB, ReactJS, and CSS, features role-based authentication for Admins and Guests. Admins have full control over the library, allowing them to add, update, and delete books, while Guests can only borrow and return books, ensuring a structured and efficient management system.
